{"category": "OCR", "question": "Which of the following figure can be described with the caption: Confocal micrographs of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) stained with PMAP-1 and MitoAP-1. a ATP on the plasma membrane was stained with PMAP-1. The bright green fluorescence observed on the plasma membrane of PMNs resulted from PMAP-1 conjugation to ATP (\u00d7100 oil objective, NA 1.4). Scale bar 10\u00a0\u03bcm. b ATP in the mitochondria was stained with MitoAP-1 (red) and MitoTracker\u00ae Green FM (green), and they colocalized well (\u00d7100 oil objective, NA 1.4). Scale bar 10\u00a0\u03bcm As in their study , the bright green fluorescence emitted by PMAP-1 was predominantly observed on the plasma membrane of PMNs ( Fig. 1a ) . MitoAP-1 fluorescence overlapped well with that of MitoTracker\u00ae Green FM , a typical dye used to stain the mitochondria , indicating that MitoAP-1 selectively and spontaneously localized to the mitochondria ( Fig. 1b ) .?\nA. <image>\nB. <image>\nC.
